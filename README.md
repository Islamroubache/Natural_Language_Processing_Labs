# ðŸ§ Natural Language Processing

This repository contains my solutions for all the laboratory exercises of the "Natural Language Processing" course at the Higher School of Computer Science (08 May 1945), Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria, for 1st-year Master's students specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

### ðŸ“ˆTP-01: Preprocessing in NLP

This TP focuses on essential preprocessing techniques such as:

- Tokenization
  
- Lowercasing

- Stopword removal

- Lemmatization and stemming

### ðŸ“ˆTP-02: Feature Extraction and Embeddings 

This TP introduces feature extraction techniques and word embeddings like:

- Bag of Words (BoW)

- TF-IDF

- Word2Vec

- GloVe

### ðŸ“ˆTP-03: Improvement of TP-02

In this TP, the goal is to enhance the feature extraction techniques from TP-02 by improving the model performance and experimenting with advanced embedding techniques.

### ðŸ“ˆTP-04: Sequence Models

This TP delves into sequence models used in NLP, such as:

- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
  
### ðŸ“ˆTP-05: Machine Translation (English to French)

- The goal of this TP is to build a basic machine translation model from English to French using sequence models or transformers.


## ðŸ“˜Tools & Technologies

- Python: Core language used for the coursework and projects 

- NLTK: For text preprocessing and tokenization 

- spaCy: NLP library for advanced text processing 

- Gensim: For word embeddings like Word2Vec 

- scikit-learn: Used for feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF 

- TensorFlow / PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks for sequence models and image captioning 

- Transformers: Used for image captioning
